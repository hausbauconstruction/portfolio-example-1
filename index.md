Hi, I’m Stefan Crabtree. I’m an entrepreneur on the web and a thinker at heart. I spent my undergrad years reading classic literature, and I got my masters degree in German history and language from Middlebury. 

My goal was—and still is—to get a broad understanding of ideas and to figure out how they fit together. After school, I spent some time in the tech field demonstrating and selling industrial robots to businesses, and then I married the love of my life and now have three beautiful daughters.
